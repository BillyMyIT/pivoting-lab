Beth,

If you're getting yourself into trouble and need to access my PC, congratulations, you've managed to surpass my level of distrust. Here are the credentials for my PC:

Username: root
Password: ngAQEa5AqgN@V5Hr

Don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean I trust your technical skills. But in case the multiverse is about to collapse or you need access to my crazy research, there you go.

If you don't remember how to use a computer, feel free to ask Morty or someone else. I don't have time for explanations right now.

Use them wisely, Beth, and don't get caught snooping around my experiments.

Rick C-137
